                            <p class="desc-text offspace-20"><b>Photography is the process of creating still or moving pictures by recording radiation on a
                              sensitive medium like film or an electronic sensor. The products of photography are called negatives and photographs, 
                               the latter being developed from the negatives. Light patterns reflected or emitted by objects activate a sensitive chemical or 
                                electronic sensor during a timed exposure usually through a photographic lens in a camera. The camera stores the resulting 
                                 information chemically or electronically.</b></p>

                             <p class="desc-text offspace-20"><b>We are all accustomed to believe by taking pictures we capture the best moments of our life, 
                               and photographs help to recall the events of the past. However, there is much more to tell. A photographer is a painter who depicts 
                                his life on a canvas by conveying certain emotions or experiences, and who describes reality the way he or she sees it or wants it to be.
                               So, we cannot always be sure whether a photograph reflects reality with the highest accuracy or vice versa, hides it. 
                              Let’s consider a number of current arguments and facts about photography, and find out what it really is.</b></p>

                            
                             <p class="desc-text offspace-20"><b>Photographers control the camera and lens to expose the light recording material to the required 
                              amount of light to form a latent image (on film) or raw file (in digital camera) which, after due processing, is converted to a usable image. 
                              In digital cameras, instead of film, an electronic image sensor based on light-sensitive devices is used.</b></p>

                             
                             <p class="desc-text offspace-20"><b>Photography can also be called an art and good photographers often exhibit their oeuvre 
                             like artists exhibit their paintings. In fact, the Greek word for photography means ‘drawing with light’. Photography has many  
                             applications in business, science and  fashion, tourism, advertising, etc.</b></p>

                             
                             <p class="desc-text offspace-20"><b>Photography is the whole world full of adventures, interesting events, stories, 
                              games of colors and light. As one of the most interesting and exciting forms of art, it appeared a long time ago,
                              and to this time has been greatly influencing the human life. In the 19th century, for example, the adherents of positivism 
                              believed that photography is a science that allows to record reality. Photography, both art and science, has constantly been
                               improved by different artists, inventors, scientists, and engineers.</b></p>
